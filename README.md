# face_landmarks
 Facial landmarks includes 68 face points are detected in this program using Dlib and OpenCV 3  in Python.
 To execute this program, shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat,a pretrained model is needed in the directory where 
 this program is stored.
 
 
 
 shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat is available in http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
 Download and extract in the same folder where the program is stored.
 
 ## Dlib
Dlib is a general purpose cross-platform software library written in the programming language C++. Its design is heavily influenced by ideas from design by contract and component-based software engineering. Thus it is, first and foremost, a set of independent software components. It is open-source software released under a Boost Software License.
